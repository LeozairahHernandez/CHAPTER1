# Introducing Flutter and Getting Started
In this chapter, I learned about important ideas like how Flutter works, the importance of widgets, and the basics of its design that you can build applications for iOS, Android, desktop, and the web all from one codebase and guided me through setting up the Flutter development environment. It covered how to install the Flutter SDK on macOS, Windows, or Linux, and how to get editors like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code ready with the needed plugins for Flutter and Dart. These tools help make development easier with features like code completion, debugging, and hot reload. I found that Flutter is a strong and modern framework that makes cross-platform app development simpler by bringing together UI design, state management, and performance improvement. Its widget-based system and powerful tools allow developers to create fast and attractive applications across different platforms. This knowledge lays a good groundwork for further learning about Flutter and Dart in app development.
